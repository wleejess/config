Hi, I’m Jess (@skywired) - it's nice to meet you!
I graduated with a B.S. in Nanoengineering and a minor in Chemistry.

A quick glance at my resume might suggest that I am simply following the laws of entropy, however, I promise there is a method to my madness.

I've always been captivated by science, specifically the application of chemistry to develop medicine. And so, I pursued a B.S. in Nanoengineering and Chemistry at UCSD. Throughout my time as both a student, I was briefly exposed to computer science and wondered if I should change majors. I decided against this, and was determined to see things through. I interned at several biotech companies and began working as a researcher. Through this experience, I further refined my strengths and interests. I developed soft skills as a project manager, and learned to analyze large, multidimensional datasets using Python. 

While I am grateful for my experiences in life sciences, I realized that it was time for a change. My next steps from there were to get my CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) certification, and to establish fundamentals in programming by pursuing a second B.S. in Computer Science at Oregon State University. 

I hope to use these combined experiences to bridge the gap between computer science and life science. As a former scientist, I can understand and empathize with their needs when it comes to applications used in research. Moreover, as I'm learning more about computer science (data structures, algorithms, web development, databases), I am confident in my abilities to translate user needs into detailed requirements to guide the development and implementation of new programs.
